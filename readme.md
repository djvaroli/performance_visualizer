# Animal Activity and Performance Visualizer

This is the first (test) version of the animal activity visualizer. 
The application contained in this repository acts as the prototype for the later versions of the improved activity monitor.

In its current form the application works to process log files from LabVIEW, containing information about 
a given animals training performance. This app allows to remotely monitor the animal, and ensure
that it's performance is being maintained at the desired level.
